NA

What do I plan to do this week:

2) Explore differenrent game options and finalize one game

4) Plan a poker session with team members and decide the size of use cases.


What blockers do I have:
-NA

Courage: 
Initially, me and my team was very confused over the game complexity and design pattern application. We were not able to decide the idea for the game. But then I showed courage to decide over the “Aladdin : The Game of Warrior” game. I am confident that we will work as a team and we will be able to deliver working game implemented using design patterns within timeline. So I did not fear have any fear and will inspire every one as we will be always there to help each other.

What I did since the last daily scrum:

1) Explored Greenfoot Tool for actor movement , jumping , running.
2) Explored differenrent game options and finalized "Game Warriors" game.
3) Wrote use case and use case specification diagram for game.
4) Planned a poker session with team members and decided the size of use cases.

What do I plan to do this week:
1) Identify and add charachters for the Game.
2) Display score, lives , levels and coins collected.
3) Identify best design pattern which will be suitable for updating score, life and levels.
4) Start implementing design pattern.

What blockers do I have:
-Left and Right movement of enemies on the jump bar.

XP Value :
Initially me and my team members could not estimate required time for all the tasks accurately due to obliviousness of the Greenfoot, But then I insisted everyone to be truthful about their progress. We sat together to explore required Greenfoot’s API and with team efforts we could finish all the task on time and we could overcome all the blockages we had.

Sprint#1- Week 1 - 11/16 - 11/22

What I did since the last daily scrum:

1) Identified and added charachters for the game.
2) Displayed scores, lives,levels and coins collcted on the screen.
3) Identified observer pattern for updating scores, life and level.
4) Started implementation for observer pattern.


What do I plan to do this week:
1) Continue implementation of observer pattern. 
2) Continue implementation of scores/ levels and coins collected.

What blockers do I have: - NA

Courage:
I always made sure that I track progress of implementation for each team members. I insisted them to report the progress and issues they are facing. In this way we could take required action on time. We were stuck sometime on a complicated problem for an entire day but then we were persistent on our efforts and we could solve the problem next day.

Sprint#2 - Week 2 - 11/23 - 11/30

What I did since the last daily scrum:

1) Implented observer pattern for updating and displaying score, lives and jevels collected on the screen.
2) Indentified abstract factory pattern for creating jewels and enemies. 
3) Identified template pattern for different types of jewels.

What do I plan to do this week:
1) Implementation of Abstract Facory pattern for jewels and enemies. 
2) Implementation of template pattern for different types of jewels. 
3) Resolve all minor bugs in the game and make it smooth. i.e. Aladding life, jump

What blockers do I have: - NA

Courage : We wanted to add something as a wow factor for our project but then we were almost near to deadline. But then I took a courage to refractor the code and to implement template design pattern and abstract facotry pattern so that future changes will be implemented easily. And I could complete implementation successfully and made sure that existing code is not affected with my refactoring and pattern implementation. In this way by We could successfully complete out Aladdin game with maintaining courage value of XP.
