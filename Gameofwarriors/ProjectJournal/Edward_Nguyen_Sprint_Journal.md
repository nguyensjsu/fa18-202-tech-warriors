XP Core Value Chosen: Respect

In the beginning, the task progress was a bit slow.
As a result, there are times when one person's opinions may be overshadowed by another.
Fortunately, as more time sunk, everyone gradually respects each other more.
When issues are brought up, everyone is free to convey their opinions.
Everyone can participate in different segments of the project and make significant contributions.
Tasks are allocated to different team members based on skill expertise.
For example, I work better with bug fixing related tasks. 
While we understand that each team member is responsible for their own work,
tasks can be reallocated in a moment's notice. 
If any work conflicts with other team members, it is the creator's task to address it.
Overall, we understand each other to the point where we can respect each of our decisions.
