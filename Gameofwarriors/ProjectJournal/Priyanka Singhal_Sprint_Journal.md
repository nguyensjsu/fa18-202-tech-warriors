XP Value - Feedback
I strongly believe that working in silos for any task kills the opportunity for a constructive feedback. For this reason when we were deciding on the game and background theme I took the initiative to start maintaining the task board. This way as soon as any of us was done with their task, the task would not be marked complete until it is reviewed and approved by all team members.
This week when we were deciding on the theme, we all shared our chosen theme images. I asked for everyone's feedback and based on mutual consent we decided on the theme.

XP Value - Feedback
This week I decided to take the initiative and created a rough prototype of our game screens. The challenge was to decide the type of game, actor positions and distinguish levels. I along with my team members drew several rough sketches of the UI and finally decided on the game screens. Creating first level prototype helped me getting a constructive feedback from my team.
I also exchanged time to time feedback with my team whenever I introduced some new sounds events to the game.
